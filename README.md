<p><strong>Christmas</strong></p>

<p>The day of the week of Christmas depends on the day of the week of the first day of December.
    For example if December 1 is Sunday, Christmas will be on a Tuesday. You will write a program to figure
    out the day of the week of Christmas when you are given the day of December 1.
    You should use integer math to solve this problem.<p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In computer science, lists generally start at index 0, rather than 1. For this lab,
Sunday will correspond to 0, Monday to 1, and so on. Saturday will correspond to 6.</p>

<strong>Assignment:</strong>
<p></p>    1.	Write a program to find the day of the week of Christmas when given the day of the week of December 1.
<div class="hint">
    You will only need to use two math operators in your algorithm.
</div>

<div class="hint">
    We will need to use the variables <strong>dayOfChristmasString</strong> and <strong>startDayOfTheMonthString</strong>
    later in this program, so you will need to declare their type.
</div>
<p></p>	2. Verify that the program gives the correct day of the week for each starting day of December, Sunday through Monday.
<p></p>    3.  Make sure your name is commented out near the top of your source code.
